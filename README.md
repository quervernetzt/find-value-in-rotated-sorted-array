# Find Value In Rotated Sorted Array

- You are given a sorted array which is rotated at some random pivot point.

- Example: [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

- You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

- You can assume there are no duplicates in the array and your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

- Example: Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0, Output: 4


# How to use it

- Run `./main.py` what will execute the test cases in `./tests` and a demo
